After downloading the zip file and extracting it, the following steps were carried out:

features <- UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt
activities <- UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt
subject_test <- UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
x_test <- UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
y_test <- UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt
subject_train <- UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
x_train <- UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
y_train <- UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt

X <- x_train and x_test merged
Y <- y_train and y_test merged
Subject <- subject_test and subject_train merged
Merged <- X, Y and Subject merged

Tidy <- subject, code and mean and standard deviation columns subset from the Merged dataframe
FinalData <- Tidy df grouped by subject and activity with average of each variable
